# OCR-Django
 Django implementation of OCR


Respected sir, 
I tried deploying this project over on heroku but it gave me an error.
This was because the maximum slug size of heroku is 500mb, while my slug was compressing to 700mb.

The project is working and fully deployable as one can try hosting it on their local machine.
